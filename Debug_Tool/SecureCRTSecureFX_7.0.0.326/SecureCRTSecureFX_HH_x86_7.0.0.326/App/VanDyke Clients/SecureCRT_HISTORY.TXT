--------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Windows: In the File menu, "Connect in Tab..." was changed to

    tab to the right.
  - If the global option "Confirm when closing multiple tabbed or

    connected and SecureCRT was closed, the confirm disconnect dialog
    was displayed.

    the following items: Tabs, Tile Vertically, Tile Horizontally,

    could become extremely large.

    option was on in the new sessions.

    appearance was set to "Background colors".  The tab is now changed

    from the toolbar, SecureCRT would crash when attempting to display
    the "View" menu.
  - Windows: After sending a tiled session to a new window, switching
    to tabbed mode, and then dragging the session back to the original
    window, the session name was not displayed.

    cursor in them when they activated.

    and Deskovery.
  - Mac: Underscores were displayed as spaces in sessions that used
    the "Andale Mono" or "Courier New" fonts.

    button bar if the configured buttons did not fit in the window.
  - Added "Send Break" to the "Edit" menu, which sends a Telnet break.
  - If a change is made to the settings of a cloned session, the
    change is propagated to the other SecureCRT windows and/or
    sessions.
  - The first tabbed session's scrollbar settings are used for
    subsequent tabbed sessions so that all the sessions will have
    the same number of rows and columns.

    opened.

    command to an SFTP tab.
  - SecureCRT crashed if a script called GetOption("[SSH2] Port")
    on a session that did not specify a firewall.
  - If a command was typed at the prompt, but ENTER was not pressed,
    and then the session was scrolled back to the oldest row and the
    top row was selected and ENTER was pressed, SecureCRT could crash.

    multi-byte escape sequence, the mapped key sometimes didn't
    work.

    not work from a custom menu.
  - If there were two tabbed sessions and there was scrollback data
    in the second tab and then the second tab was disconnected and
    reused for a different session, the scrollback was not cleared.
  - When Zmodem was used to transfer a file larger than 2 GB, the
    progress information was not correct.
  - If /Log was specified on the command line and additional parameters
    such as session name or username were also specified, the /Log

    "zlib@openssh.com" compression was being used, the session
    disconnected.

    interactive method more than once.
